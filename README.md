# Improving Generalization in Deep Metric Learning through Intra-Class Fine-Grained Features and Supervised Triplet Sampling

This repository contains code and resources related to the article titled "Improving Generalization in Deep Metric Learning through Intra-Class Fine-Grained Features and Supervised Triplet Sampling"

## Description

Explore our novel approach to deep metric learning designed for capturing subtle distinctions among samples within the same class. Our method leverages fine-grained feature learning and supervised triplet sampling, significantly improving generalization to unseen classes. Experiment results on the Cars196 dataset demonstrate superior performance in correctly identifying previously unseen classes. Dive into the code and unleash the power of fine-grained deep metric learning.
